<!--This is the template for each semester's worth of lectures.
    This code produces a table for each semester. Each file consists
    of one semester of lectures. The files are to be included in
    davincilectures.shtml in reverse chronological order.
    The lectures themselves in each file are to be listed in
    chronological order.
    
    Each lecture usually comes with a poster. If it does come with
    a poster,  it is displayed in a popup via Reveal, a Foundation 3
    javascript library. To utilize this nifty popup, add the <a> tag
    like in the example template below to the name of the lecture.
    IMAGENAME is the name of the poster image (convention is
    firstnamelastname of professor). You then use this same IMAGENAME
    in includes/davincilectures/lectureposters.htm - the instructions
    are in that file.
